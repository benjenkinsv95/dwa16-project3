Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary, system manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor. Longing for the warmth of bedsheets, still I sat there, doing spreadsheets; having reached the bottom line, I took a floppy from the drawer. Typing with a steady hand, then invoked the SAVE command. But I got a reprimand: it read "Abort, Retry, Ignore." Was this some occult illusion? Some maniacal intrusion? These were choices Solomon himself had never faced before. Carefully, I weighed my options. These three seemed to be the top ones. Clearly I must now adopt one: Choose "Abort, Retry, Ignore." With my fingers pale and trembling, slowly toward the keyboard bending, longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored, praying for some guarantee. Finally I pressed a key-- But on the screen what did I see? Again:  "Abort, Retry, Ignore." I tried to catch the chips off-guard-- I pressed again, but twice as hard. Luck was just not in the cards. I saw what I had seen before. Now I typed in desperation. Trying random combinations. Still there came the incantation: Choose: "Abort, Retry, Ignore." There I sat, distraught exhausted, by my own machine accosted. Getting up I turned away and paced across the office floor. And then I saw an awful sight: A bold and blinding flash of light-- A lightning bolt had cut the night and shook me to my very core. I saw the screen collapse and die. "Oh no--my data base," I cried. I thought I heard a voice reply, "You'll see your data Nevermore!" To this day I do not know the place to which lost data goes. I bet it goes to heaven where the angels have it stored, but as for productivity, well I fear that IT goes straight to hell. And that's the tale I have to tell. Your choice:  "Abort, Retry, Ignore."
